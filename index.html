		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>My name is <em>Landon Voss</em> and incredibly excited
			 to be taking Accessible Computing here at A&M this semester. 
			 I'm a CS senior, come from Cypress, Texas and hope to one day work with 
			 developing emerging VR technologies with accessibility in mind.</p>
			 
		<h2>Accessible Technology</h2>
        <p>My interests in accessible technology revolve around the 
			idea that <strong>everyone</strong> should be able to interact with the 
			everyday technologies that are actively changing our world for the better. 
			I'm especially interested in better understanding those 
			with visual and motor impairments and the various ways 
			that they must interact with daily technologies that non-disabled 
			people don't ever have to think about.</p>

        <h3>Here's a short list of a few accessibility devices that I find interesting:</h3>
        <ul>
			<li>Virtual Assistants (such as Amazon Echo / Google Home)</li>
			<li>Screen Readers</li>
			<li>Braille Technologies</li>
